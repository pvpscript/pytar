# pytar
An extremely simple tar wrapper that adds data as files in a tarball

# Introduction
I wrote this code for a script I was writing that required raw data to be added as files and compressed inside a tarball. It makes use of the native python lib, [tarfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html)
